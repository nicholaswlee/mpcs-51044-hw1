## Exercise 4
The easiest way to break a program is by using keywords that are not defined in the program. For C to break C++, this just means using C++ keywords in C code. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int namespace = 5;
    printf("%d\n", namespace);
    return 0;
}
```
This will break the program because `namespace` is a keyword in C++ but not in C.
